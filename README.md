The end of chapter labs, conceptual questions, and exercises for the book "An Introduciton to Statistical Learning: With Application is Python" by Gareth James, Daniella Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jonathan Taylor.

A similar repository made by a-martyn was a huge help to me while setting up this repository. Thanks a lot Alan. 

Note: I did not do all the labs and all the conceptual questions due to time constraints.
